# Hangman
A game of Hangman implemented in Smalltalk
## A note on version control
Source code for this repository is contained in the `src` directory in the form of `.mcz` files.
These are files created by the Monticello package manager. To import this repository into your 
instance of Smalltalk, clone this git repository to your computer as you would any other. Then 
use Monticello to import the packages into your Smalltalk image.

This is an example of placing version controled files in more version control. This is due 
to the fact that Pharo's native git integration tool, Iceberg, is still unsatisfactory, and
GitHub is prefered over SmalltalkHub for source distribution.
